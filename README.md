# Sports Tracking System #
I created a GUI in java using JavaFX for the UI, this featured a tracking system for sports 
activities in which the user could add, remove and update sports entries saving them in an xml file. 

This project was for my G52GUI module, where the marks will be released in January 2014 and 
I will update the project based on feedback.
